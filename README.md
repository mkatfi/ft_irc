## 💫 Summary
**ft_IRC** is a project designed to replicate the functionality of an IRC server, allowing users to interact in real-time through text messaging. It follows the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol, implementing both the server-side logic and client-side communication.

### 🔮 Definition
"IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a protocol for real-time text messaging between internet-connected computers created in 1988. It is mainly used for group discussion in chat rooms called 'channels,' although it supports private messages between two users, data transfer, and various server-side and client-side commands."

### 💾 Subject Requirements
1. Code the IRC server in **C++98**.
2. The binary should look like: `./ircserv <port> <password>`.
3. Use the `poll()` function exactly once.
4. Implement client/server communication over TCP/IP (v4 or v6).
5. Mandatory features:
   - Registering a user (nickname, username).
   - Joining a channel, sending, and receiving private messages.
   - All messages sent in a channel must be received by all users in that channel.
   - Implement both normal users and operators with specific commands.
6. Handle signals (CTRL+C, CTRL+D, CTRL+Z) and avoid memory leaks.
7. (Bonus) Implement a bot and file transfer feature.

### 🔆 Commands Implemented:
| Command  | Description |

| **Invite**  | Invites a user to a channel. |
| **Join**    | Joins a given channel with the specified key. |
| **Kick**    | Removes a user from a channel. |

| **Part**    | Removes a client from a channel. |
| **Pass**    | Sets a connection password. |
| **Ping**    | Checks if the server/client connection is alive. |

- **Tips:**
  1. Start with a working client/server socket connection.
  2. Implement signal handling (CTRL+C, CTRL+D, CTRL+Z).
  3. Proceed with client registration (NICK, USER, PASS).
  4. Build the server commands (PING, OPER, KILL).
  5. Implement channel operations (JOIN, PART, INVITE, KICK, PRIVMSG, NOTICE).

- **Debugging Tip:**
  - If your code works with irssi but not with nc, remember that irssi handles messages differently by sending everything at once, including CRLF endings. With `nc`, you need to manage message concatenation and ensure that each message is correctly formatted.

- **Dynamic Macros:**
  - Using macros for clean and efficient code:
    ```cpp
    #define user_id(nickname, username) (":" + nickname + "!" + username + "@localhost")
    #define RPL_INVITE(user_id, invited, channel) (user_id + " INVITE " + invited + " #" + channel + "\r\n")
    ```
